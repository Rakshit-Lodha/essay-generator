      "\n",
      "1. **The Birth of AI (1950s):** The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during the Dartmouth Conference. This era also saw the development of the first AI programs, such as the Logic Theorist and the General Problem Solver, which laid the groundwork for future advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Golden Years (1960s-1970s):** AI research flourished with funding and interest. Notable achievements include ELIZA, an early natural language processing program, and Shakey the Robot, the first mobile robot to reason about its actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The AI Winter (1970s-1980s):** Despite early successes, AI faced setbacks due to high expectations and limited computational power, leading to reduced funding and interest—a period now known as the \"AI Winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Revival and Growth (1990s-2000s):** AI experienced a resurgence with advances in machine learning and increased computational capabilities. IBM's Deep Blue made history by defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The AI Boom (2010s-Present):** With the advent of big data and powerful GPUs, AI technologies like deep learning have revolutionized industries. AI systems now excel at tasks ranging from image recognition to autonomous driving.\n",
